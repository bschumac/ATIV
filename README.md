# ATIV

Welcome to Adaptive Thermal Image Velocimetry. This package is designed to give the user a quick access to run A-TIV and TIV algorithms. 

Current Version: 0.1


## 1. Intorduction

Thermal Image Velocimetry is an optical flow algorithm, based on particle image velocimetry techniques designed to estimate spatial wind velocities from thermal video. The algorithm was initially described by Inagaki (2013) who used particle image velocimetry techniques of Kaga (1992) on thermal video of thermally responsive artificial surfaces to estimate spatial wind velocities. The technique was further investigated by Schumacher (2019) on artificial created patterns to test the user input settings. With this package we are presenting now the evolution of the TIV algorithm A-TIV which allows to retrieve spatial velocities over a wider range of surface types with less user-input needed. 

## 2. Setup

At the current stage there is unfortunately no quick setup available. We are currently working on this to provide an updated version with a setup file.
